# Bubble of Emotions Animation Project

## How to Interact
- Play Music: Click on any bubble to play the corresponding song. Each bubble represents a different emotion and will trigger a unique audio file.
- Pause/Resume Music: Use the "Play/Stop" button at the bottom of the screen to pause or resume the currently playing song.
- Observe Animation: Move the mouse slowly over the screen to interact with the bubbles. Notice how the bubbles move and change size in response to the audio being played.
- Responsive Bubbles: Watch how the size of the bubbles reacts to the sound level of the playing audio, creating a dynamic visual experience.

## Individual Approach
- Audio Interaction: My code uniquely drives the animation based on audio input, making the bubbles react to the sound level of the playing song.
- Gradient Colors and Text Effects: The use of gradient colors and dynamic text effects within the bubbles sets my animation apart, providing a visually engaging experience.
